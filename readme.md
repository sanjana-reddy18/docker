## Local Development Environment

### Docker Compose Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-service.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-service
    ```

3. Run the following command to start the local development environment:
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

This will spin up the necessary services defined in the Docker Compose file for local development.

### Verification in GitHub Actions

Automated testing is configured using GitHub Actions. Check the workflow in [.github/workflows/test.yml](.github/workflows/test.yml) for details on how the local Docker Compose environment is utilized for testing.

## Production Deployment

### Docker Compose for Production

The Docker Compose configuration in [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) is designed to be adaptable for production use. Ensure to modify environment variables and configurations for production, considering scalability and security aspects.

For a production deployment:

1. Update environment variables in the `.env` file or use system environment variables.
2. Make necessary adjustments to the Docker Compose file.
3. Optionally, explore container orchestration tools like Docker Swarm or Kubernetes for production deployments.

### Assumptions

Document any assumptions about the production deployment target, such as infrastructure, networking, security, etc., in [Assumptions.md](Assumptions.md).
